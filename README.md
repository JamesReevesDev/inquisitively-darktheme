## Inquisitively's Dark Theme
This is the first theme I've ever created. I wanted to start coding all my personal projects in 
the same theme that I use in the code snippet plug in on https://www.Inquisitively.io
I hope that you enjoy it:

Languages I use and checked the theme for:
1. Python
2. HTML
3. CSS
4. C#

You're welcome to use the theme and let me know how it looks for other languages.
